# Repository AGENTS

## 1. Scope

This file defines repository-local operating rules.

Reusable Apple and iOS engineering guidance lives in `skills/` and should not be duplicated here unless the rule is genuinely repository-specific.

## 2. Repository Workflow

- When modifying code, only make changes directly related to the request. Do not auto-format, restyle, or refactor surrounding code that was not asked to be changed.
- Prefer checking the existing repository structure and active patterns before editing.
- For UI-related work, provide a concrete plan first. Use ASCII sketches when a layout or flow benefits from visual structure.
- Use `Git worktree` when isolation is helpful for multi-step feature work.
- Use commit messages in the format `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`.
- Before handing off significant changes, summarize what changed, how it was verified, and any remaining risk.

## 3. Project-Specific Constraints

- Prefer existing project patterns over introducing a new local convention in one file.
- Keep build, resource, and module ownership explicit; do not assume everything belongs in a global bucket by default.
- Network-facing code must surface failure paths explicitly rather than silently ignoring errors.
- New business logic should include unit-test coverage when the repository has an established place for that coverage.
- Critical user flows should keep or gain UI-test coverage when the repository already exercises that path.
- If the task depends on product design, prefer the existing Figma or design-source direction and do not hardcode ad hoc visual values when a design token or existing asset should be used.
- When using CocoaPods with KuaiLiao spec sources, use `https://github.com/KuaiLiao/KLSpecs.git` as the pod source.

## 4. Security And Safety

- Do not hardcode secrets, passwords, tokens, or private service endpoints.
- When a feature touches camera, microphone, photo library, location, or similar sensitive capabilities, verify the required privacy descriptions exist.
- Before adding a new third-party dependency, verify that its license is acceptable for the project.
- Avoid destructive repository actions unless they are explicitly requested.
- Follow App Store Review Guidelines when implementing features that interact with payments, user data, or platform capabilities.

## 5. Skill Routing

This project is UIKit-first with Swift/Objective-C mixed codebases and SwiftUI used as a secondary UI layer.

Route by the dominant problem shape:

| Problem shape | Skill |
| --- | --- |
| UIKit screens, collection views, diffable data source, compositional layout, keyboard-safe layout, navigation, scenes, presentation | `uikit-modern` |
| Objective-C ownership, blocks, runtime behavior, KVC/KVO, swizzling, forwarding, mixed-language legacy concerns | `objective-c-patterns` |
| Swift language behavior, concurrency, Combine, Codable, observation, Swift Testing, SwiftUI screens, version-sensitive decisions | `swift-modern` |
| Project structure, architecture selection, package strategy, dependency selection, modular boundaries | `project-structure-architecture` |

Triage rules:

1. Identify the dominant layer: UIKit UI, Objective-C behavior, Swift language/SwiftUI UI, or project architecture.
2. If multiple layers are involved, name the dominant one before loading a second skill.
3. Read the matching specialist skill before answering from memory.
4. Load a second specialist skill only when the task genuinely spans two domains.
5. Keep one specialist skill as the primary owner so guidance stays coherent.
6. Keep reusable language, UIKit, Objective-C, architecture, and library-selection guidance inside the skill system rather than expanding this file.

## 6. Platform Capabilities Quick Reference

Key APIs introduced per iOS version. Use this to determine what is available at the project's deployment target.

| iOS | Key additions |
| --- | --- |
| 17 | `@Observable` macro (replaces `ObservableObject`), `@Bindable`, SwiftData, TipKit |
| 18 | SwiftData `#Index` and `#Unique`, Control Center widgets, `@Previewable` preview macro |
| 26 | Liquid Glass design system, new translucent materials, Modern Tab API |
